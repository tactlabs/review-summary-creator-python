BlueStone is a lovely place - chaotic but lovely!
Top 2 guys are absolute gems! Humble yet extremely smart. 
Due to their bandwidth constraint, they, at times, do lend their ears to a few troublemakers (read: company savers in their own eyes 
and that causes a few folks some hiccups at times.
If you want to, you can take complete ownership of the work and deliver. You may have to put up a brave front
Good opportunity to learn
Freedom to work
Relaxed culture
The work that we get here is super amazing where in you get to learn various technologies and you're given complete ownership of your work.
The ambience is friendly , and all the colleagues and managers are really helpful.
Great place to learn because bluestone is evolving and will keep on evolving in terms of technologies used.
A special mention to the tea we get here which is super awesome
I have worked with some CMM level 5 company as well but the on boarding experience with Bluestone is most amazing so far. HR have been too friendly from offer to joining, even after joining. They do care about your needs as a new employee. Them made me completly free from other burdens of shifting, relocating and all, so that I can focus on my Job.
Other Pros are:
Good Environment to work.
Friendly 
since the org is lean, you will have more responsibilities to handle, learn and grow
friendly people
managers and leaders will trust you with execution
